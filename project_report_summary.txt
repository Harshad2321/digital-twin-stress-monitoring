DIGITAL TWIN FOR STRESS MONITORING - PROJECT SUMMARY
====================================================

PROBLEM:
Traditional stress monitoring relies on single metrics. This project develops a 
comprehensive digital twin approach combining multiple physiological and behavioral 
indicators for holistic stress assessment.

OBJECTIVES:
1. Create a fusion wellness index combining multiple health metrics
2. Identify distinct lifestyle patterns through clustering
3. Analyze temporal stress variations
4. Develop predictive models for stress levels

METHODOLOGY:
- Dataset: 1398 records with 15+ health and lifestyle parameters
- Novel Fusion Wellness Index: Weighted combination of sleep, activity, physiological metrics
- K-means clustering for lifestyle pattern identification
- Temporal analysis for stress trend detection
- Machine learning models for stress prediction

NOVELTY CONTRIBUTIONS:
1. ðŸš€ Fusion Wellness Index: First comprehensive wellness metric combining sleep quality, 
   activity levels, physiological parameters, and screen time
2. ðŸš€ Lifestyle Clustering: Data-driven identification of distinct lifestyle patterns 
   and their relationship to stress
3. ðŸš€ Temporal Analysis: Time-series analysis revealing stress patterns across days, 
   weeks, and periods

KEY RESULTS:
â€¢ Fusion Wellness Index: Mean=0.557, Correlation with Stress=-0.024
â€¢ Lifestyle Clustering: 4 distinct groups identified
â€¢ Highest stress cluster: 1 (avg stress: 8.60)
â€¢ Lowest stress cluster: 3 (avg stress: 3.81)
â€¢ Temporal Analysis: Weekend stress 5.47 vs Weekday stress 5.39
â€¢ Peak stress day: Friday (6.26)
â€¢ Strongest negative correlation: Lifestyle_Cluster (-0.207)
â€¢ Best model: Logistic Regression (Accuracy: 0.511)
â€¢ Most important feature: Fusion_Wellness_Index (Importance: 0.167)

FUTURE SCOPE:
- Real-time stress monitoring dashboard
- Personalized wellness recommendations based on cluster membership
- Integration with wearable devices for continuous monitoring
- Advanced deep learning models for stress prediction
- Multi-modal analysis including voice and facial expression data

IMPACT:
This digital twin approach provides a holistic view of stress factors, enabling 
personalized interventions and preventive healthcare strategies.
